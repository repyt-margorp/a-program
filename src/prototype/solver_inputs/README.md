# Direct Solver Inputs

Prototype prerequisite to the [Solver/Evidence plan, SE1](../../../doc/2026-09-30-SOLVER-EVIDENCE-DUPLICATION-AUDIT-AND-PLAN.md).
Applies after the artifact/readback/conversion candidate, not to accepted code.

## Problem List

1. Completed typed inputs should not require scheduler allocations.

### Subjective (User)

2026-09-30 paraphrase: question Job itself, remove duplicated construction, and
finish the ownership refactor before extending persistence or the C backend.

### Objective (Code)

The migration covers typed WHNF/NF and closed evaluation demands, including
binding/domain normalization, CLI demands and IADT endpoint normalization;
Context reindexing, substitution source/destination inputs; post-synthesis
type expectations; and rule premises, including their structural queries,
scope readers, checking, export and checkpoint consumers.
An input directly borrows checked Evidence or its pending producer. The two
pointers are passed/stored by value; there is no allocated wrapper, result table
or new Core tag. Pending request identity does not change when its input finishes.

Source transport visits checked leaves without allocating Jobs. Its temporary
pointer-membership index is destroyed after export; the existing rule payload
and file layout are unchanged. Read still creates ordinary unchecked premises.
Rule requests use the same hash lookup for direct and legacy inputs, borrowing
the key during lookup and copying it only on a miss. Structural queries retain
only a result, child query and normalization pointer, not the broad source state.
Composition and lifting no longer allocate a `CHECKED_QUERY_JOB`: constructor
scope and Identity-family owners borrow the existing typed query directly.
The query keeps its sole progress/status/result. Any query advance consumes
the caller's dispatch, preventing two advances through a completion boundary.

### Assessment

This removes some adapters, not the independent Job graph. Source scopes,
classifier operands, substitution images and other context/IADT/Identity
constructors still use adapters. Several producer-to-checked forwarding paths
also remain; removing the query wrapper does not settle their ownership.
Keeping those indefinitely would not
complete SE1. No semantic boundary has been merged merely to reduce node count.

### Plan

Use the parent plan for progress. Create and verify a disposable candidate:

```sh
bash src/prototype/solver_inputs/overlay.sh /tmp/a-program-direct-inputs
make -f /tmp/a-program-direct-inputs/src/Makefile BUILD=/tmp/a-program-direct-inputs/build check
make -f src/prototype/artifact_persistence/build.mk \
  OVERLAY=/tmp/a-program-direct-inputs BUILD=/tmp/a-program-direct-inputs/build \
  CHECKPOINT_TESTS=/tmp/a-program-direct-inputs/checkpoint_tests/ \
  check-artifact-normalization-checkpoint check-artifact-source-checkpoint \
  check-artifact-derivation-checkpoint check-artifact-definition-checkpoint \
  check-artifact-namespace-frontier check-artifact-namespace-body-frontier \
  check-artifact-constructor-checkpoint
```

`ARTIFACT_SOURCE` selects an isolated accepted-source snapshot when the worktree
contains unrelated edits. Keep that baseline explicit in verification reports.
The optional checkpoint-test directory adapts assertions to the new premise
representation without changing the artifact-only candidate's tests.
